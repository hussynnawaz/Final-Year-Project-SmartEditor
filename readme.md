<h2>Abstract</h2>

The PDF Editor application will allow users to edit a PDF Document. By default, a PDF document can be edited. As it is mostly used for viewing online, and for printing. If the user has lost access to the original document, and somehow wants to edit the document and make necessary changes to it, this application will help users to achieve it efficiently and easily. PDF Editor Application will have an interface like a word document, so user can have full access. 

The Smart editor application will have features like scaling the document, changing the font style, font size, color of the font, color of page, page orientation and size. As the application’s name defines it is an editor, so the application will provide full editor access to the document just like any other word processing application like Libre Office, Microsoft Office.  

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The main reason of writing this document is to show all details which are present in our SMART editor mobile application. We will explain the purpose of developing this application, its complete features, its working, interface and how user can interact with this app. 
We will discuss how efficiently it is to edit a PDF Document. If a user has lost access to original and they have to make some necessary changes to the document, like updating the date, adding some new text to document, adjusting font size, style, color, and alignment of text. 
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
As the document name says, PDF (Portable Document Format). is an open file format used for exchanging electronic documents. Documents, forms, images, and web pages encoded in PDF can be correctly displayed on any device, including smartphones and tablets. If you distribute your reports in PDF, you can be sure that all of your colleagues will be able to open and read it on their PCs, Macs or Android smartphones
As some earlier version of this specific application don’t have much features, and was built for Desktop Systems. With this mobile application user will be abble to edit the document directly from phone. 
Problem Solution for Proposed System
As this is a mobile application, everyone will have access to it. 
User can use their phone directly for document editing and conversion. 
Several features for document conversion. 
#Advantages/Benefits of Proposed System
User friendly interface
Light weight mobile application
Native app available for both Android and iOS. 
All in one application for document conversions, from any format to the other. 
Scope
The user will login to their account, if they already have an account, if not they will create a new account, for storing documents in database for later use. However, they will also be able to use the app as guest user, where the files after being edited ot converted may not be saved in database. 
The user will be able to edit the file, convert it to any other format of their choice and then download the file. 
Files cannot be shared online to others, and can b e

Modules
The application has the following modules
Module 1:  Document Editing
In document editing module, user will be able to edit the PDF Document. The application will provide all necessary features for editing any document like, scaling, changing font size, color, adding margins, page no and add some water marks to it. 
Module 2:  Document Conversion
This module will enable user to convert their document to any other format. File can be converted to word document, a powerpoint presentation. 
The user may also convert other documents like extract text from images and create a PDF from it. 
System Limitations/Constraints
System will not be able to convert multiple files from one format to another simultaneously. System cannot be used to share files online with others. 
	
Software Process Methodology
The software process methodology that i’ve chosen is Agile Methodology. 
Agile project management is an iterative approach to product delivery that builds incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver the entire product at once near the end.
